Bugs:

1. Heroku deployment issue:
I kept getting an error message "failed to push some refs to git@heroku.com" which was due that the Procfile was sitting in the templates foolder instead of the root. After a short research and systematic reference back to the CI modules the issue was indetified and resolved. The heroku deployment was succesful afterwards.
